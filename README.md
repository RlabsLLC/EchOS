# EchOS 0.3 Preview (Coming Soon!)
EchOS software update/install page for computers compatible with EchOS. Download the installer to continue with proper setup. (Only works on Linux x64 for now; ARM64 support coming in EchOS 0.4 Linux build.)

# Bugs found

[Install_Util] VERY UNSTABLE!! It's highly likely that you will need to REINSTALL when you update. Until future notice, press the update with caution. If the software doesnt start, run the newly installed Backup OS

# Next Preview (EchOS 0.3.1) will have these features:

Bug fixes (see above)

Desktop UI (in development)

Window UI (Already Integrated... but hidden)
